Objective: The purpose of this paper is to compare machine learning techniques in their application to EHR analysis for disease detection. Methods: The Pedianet database was used as a data source for a real-world scenario on the identification of cases of varicella. The models' training and test sets were based on two different Italian regions' (Veneto and Sicilia) data sets of 7631 patients and 1,230,355 records, and 2347 patients and 569,926 records, respectively, for whom a gold standard of varicella diagnosis was available. Elastic-net regularized generalized linear model (GLMNet), maximum entropy (MAXENT), and LogitBoost (boosting) algorithms were implemented in a supervised environment and 5-fold cross-validated. The document-term matrix generated by the training set involves a dictionary of 1,871,532 tokens. The analysis was conducted on a subset of 29,096 tokens, corresponding to a matrix with no more than a 99% sparsity ratio. Results: The highest predictive values were achieved through boosting (positive predicative value [PPV] 63.1, 95% CI 42.7-83.5 and negative predicative value [NPV] 98.8, 95% CI 98.3-99.3). GLMNet delivered superior predictive capability compared to MAXENT (PPV 24.5% and NPV 98.3% vs PPV 11.0% and NPV 98.0%). MAXENT and GLMNet predictions weakly agree with each other (agreement coefficient 1 [AC1]=0.60, 95% CI 0.58-0.62), as well as with LogitBoost (MAXENT: AC1=0.64, 95% CI 0.63-0.66 and GLMNet: AC1=0.53, 95% CI 0.51-0.55). Conclusions: Boosting has demonstrated promising performance in large-scale EHR-based infectious disease identification. © Corrado Lanera, Paola Berchialla, Ileana Baldi, Giulia Lorenzoni, Lara Tramontan, Antonio Scamarcia, Luigi Cantarutti, Carlo Giaquinto, Dario Gregori.

Envisaging a ""run-in""process in study design may accomplish this task; however, the traditional run-in requires additional patients, increasing times, and costs. The possible use of the available a-priori data could skip the run-in period. In this regard, ML (machine learning) techniques, which have recently shown considerable promising usage in clinical research, can be used to construct individual predictions of therapy response probability conditional on patient characteristics. An ensemble model of ML techniques was trained and validated on twin randomized clinical trials to mimic a run-in process within this framework. An ensemble ML model composed of 26 algorithms was trained on the twin clinical trials. SuperLearner (SL) performance for the Verum (Treatment) arm is above 70% sensitivity. The Positive Predictive Value (PPP) achieves a value of 80%. Results show good performance in the direction of being useful in the simulation of the run-in period; the trials conducted in similar settings can train an optimal patient selection algorithm minimizing the run-in time and costs of conduction.  © 2022 Corrado Lanera et al.","","Algorithms;

Its unstructured nature, however, presents significant challenges in the extraction of meaningful information. This study presents a deep learning model for classifying otitis using pediatric medical records. We analyzed the Pedianet database, which includes data from January 2004 to August 2017. The model categorizes narratives from clinical record diagnoses into six types: no otitis, non-media otitis, non-acute otitis media (OM), acute OM (AOM), AOM with perforation, and recurrent AOM. Utilizing deep learning architectures, including an ensemble model, this study addressed the challenges associated with the manual classification of extensive narrative data. The performance of the model was evaluated according to a gold standard classification made by three expert clinicians. The ensemble model achieved values of 97.03, 93.97, 96.59, and 95.48 for balanced precision, balanced recall, accuracy, and balanced F1 measure, respectively. These results underscore the efficacy of using automated systems for medical diagnoses, especially in pediatric care. Our findings demonstrate the potential of deep learning in interpreting complex medical records, enhancing epidemiological surveillance and research. This approach offers significant improvements in handling large-scale medical data, ensuring accuracy and minimizing human error. The methodology is adaptable to other medical contexts, promising a new horizon in healthcare analytics. © 2023 by the authors.","electronic medical record; machine learning; otitis; real-world data; text mining","acute otitis media; algorithm; Article; child; computer model; convolutional neural network; deep learning; epidemiological monitoring; epidemiological surveillance; error; female; Free text Medical Notes; gold standard; hospital admission; human; machine learning; male; mass communication; medical record; otitis; otitis media; patient care; pediatrics; prescription; validation process","","","","","","","Jamal A., Alsabea A., Tarakmeh M., Safar A., Etiology, Diagnosis, Complications, and Management of Acute Otitis Media in Children, Cureus, 14, (2022); Barbieri E., Dona D., Cantarutti A., Lundin R., Scamarcia A., Corrao G., Cantarutti L., Giaquinto C., Antibiotic Prescriptions in Acute Otitis Media and Pharyngitis in Italian Pediatric Outpatients, Ital.

The clinical value of NSVT in the population of PM patients is still uncertain. Our aim was to assess the prevalence of NSVT detected by remote PM control, to describe the clinical and demographic characteristics of patients with NSVT, and to assess the prognostic significance of NSVT in terms of both overall and cardiovascular mortality. Methods: Consecutive patients followed with PM remote interrogations from September 2010 to December 2015 were included. The transmissions pertaining to the first 12 months of remote control were analysed and the patients were divided by those presenting NSVT and those without NSVT. The two groups were compared in terms of total mortality and cardiovascular mortality based on the administrative data provided by the regional administration of the Italian National Health System. Results: The prevalence of NSVT in 408 patients (62% males, mean age 75.6; SD 10.6 years old) was 21% in a year. During a mean follow-up duration of 44 months, NSVT did not emerge as independently associated with overall mortality, but was associated with cardiovascular mortality in a competing risk regression model with older age, male gender, diabetes, chronic renal insufficiency, ischemic cardiomyopathy and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Conclusions: We show that NSVT episodes recorded by remote control in a PM population are independently associated with cardiovascular mortality with possible implications for risk stratification and therapeutic options. © 2019 The Authors","Cardiovascular mortality; Non-sustained ventricular tachycardia; Pacemaker; Remote interrogation","amiodarone; antiarrhythmic agent; adult; aortic valve disease; Article; cardiovascular mortality; diabetes mellitus; female; heart left ventricle ejection fraction; heart ventricle tachycardia; human; ischemic cardiomyopathy; major clinical study; male; prevalence; priority journal","","amiodarone, 1951-25-3, 19774-82-4, 62067-87-2","","","","","Chen J., Johnson G., Hellkamp A.S., Et al., Rapid-rate nonsustained ventricular tachycardia found on implantable cardioverter-defibrillator interrogation: relationship to outcomes in the SCD-HeFT (Sudden Cardiac Death in Heart Failure Trial), J.

Due to the effort required for the population to adopt appropriate behaviors in response to the emergency, it is essential to inform the public of the epidemic situation with transparent data sources. The COVID-19ita project aimed to develop a public open-source tool to provide timely, updated information on the pandemic’s evolution in Italy. It is a web-based application, the front end for the eponymously named R package freely available on GitHub, deployed both in English and Italian. The web application pulls the data from the official repository of the Italian COVID-19 outbreak at the national, regional, and provincial levels. The app allows the user to select information to visualize data in an interactive environment and compare epidemic situations over time and across different Italian regions. At the same time, it provides insights about the outbreak that are explained and commented upon to yield reasoned, focused, timely, and updated information about the outbreak evolution. © 2022 by the authors.

The study aims to create an algorithm that classifies patients into homogeneous groups according to physical function. A two-step machine-learning algorithm was applied to administrative data recorded between 2015 and 2018 at the University Hospital of Padova. A clustering-large-applications (CLARA) algorithm was used to partition patients into homogeneous groups. Then, machine learning technique (MLT) classifiers were used to categorize the doubtful records. Based on the results of the CLARA algorithm, records were divided into three groups according to the Barthel index: <45, >65, ≥45 and ≤65. The support vector machine was the MLT showing the best performance among doubtful records, reaching an accuracy of 66%. The two-step algorithm, since it splits patients into low and high resource consumption, could be a useful tool for organizing healthcare personnel allocation according to the patients’ assistance needs. © 2020 by the authors.

However, they have never been clinically validated. Thus, we compared the clinical and prognostic impact of LA volume assessed by MOD and ALM by using both the 2015 and 2005 abnormality thresholds. Methods In a retrospective study of 467 patients with sinus rhythm and various cardiac conditions (median age 61 years, 68% men), maximal LA volumes were measured with MOD and ALM. Patients were followed for 3.7 ± 1.1 years to record both all-cause mortality and cardiac death. Results Applying the 2015 cutoff values, 21% of patients with dilated LA according to the 2005 recommendations were reclassified as normal. Severity of LA dilatation was reclassified in 48% (222/467) patients. ALM provided significantly larger LA volumes than MOD (41 [32; 58] mL/m2 vs 39 [30; 55] mL/m2; P =.0150), reclassifying 18% (84/467) of patients. Patients who died had larger LA volumes measured with both MOD (57 [38; 77] mL/m2 vs 37 [30; 51] mL/m2; P <.0001) and ALM (58 [40; 82] mL/m2 vs 40 [32; 54] mL/m2; P <.0001). Regardless of the method used, LA volume was a significant factor associated with mortality, with both the 2015 and 2005 cutoff values providing similar prognostic power. Conclusions The use of 2015 partition values and different methods of LA volume measurement leads to significant changes in patients' clinical profiles. LA enlargement is an important prognostic indicator independent of cutoff values and methods used. Care should be taken to ensure consistent measurements and interpretation of two-dimensional echocardiography LA volume during patient follow-up. © 2017 American Society of Echocardiography","Left atrial volume index; Prognosis; Two-dimensional echocardiography","Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Atrial Fibrillation; Atrial Function, Left; Cardiac Volume; Cross-Sectional Studies; Echocardiography; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Heart Atria; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Prognosis; Reproducibility of Results; Retrospective Studies; adult; all cause mortality; area length method; Article; cardiovascular parameters; clinical assessment; cohort analysis; disease association; disease severity; female; follow up; heart death; heart disease; heart left atrium; heart volume; human; intermethod comparison; major clinical study; male; method of disk; middle aged; prognosis; reference value; retrospective study; sinus rhythm; two dimensional echocardiography; aged; atrial fibrillation; cross-sectional study; diagnostic imaging; echocardiography; heart atrium; heart atrium function; heart volume; pathophysiology; physiology; procedures; prognosis; reproducibility; very elderly","","","","","GE Vingmed; TomTec Imaging Systems; European Society of Cardiology, ESC; European Association of Cardiovascular Imaging, EACVI","Funding text 1: Dr. Surkova has recieved a research grant from the European Society of Cardiology and a training grant from the European Association of Cardiovascular Imaging.

Patients and Methods: From July 15th to August 15th 2020, a retrospective survey referring to the period March 9th to May 18th 2020 was administered to SLE patients and the results of the survey, called LEPRE (Lupus Erythematosus PREsto) study, were compared with those from the PRESTO (imPact of quaRantine mEasures againST cOvid19) project, the same survey provided to the general population. Consecutive patients >18 years old affected by SLE and regularly followed in a single rheumatologic centre were involved. Primary outcome was to compare the scores of the Impact of Events Scale-Revised (IES-R), the General Health Questionnaire 12 (GHQ-12) and the Center for Epidemiological Depression Scale (CES-D) between patients and general population. Results: A total of 64 patients completed the survey. After a propensity score matching, they were compared to 128 people from PRESTO project. The median age among patients was 43 years (I–III interquartile range 35–54.5), 88% were female and 100% Caucasian. IES-R [(score>23: 57% (34) vs 49% (58)], GHQ-12 [(score>13: 85% (52) vs 88% (106)], and CES-D [(score>15: 45% (28) vs 40% (46)] scores were not statistically different between patients and controls (p>0.05). Conclusion: Restrictive measures for COVID-19 pandemic had no greater impact on patients with SLE than in the general population. Strategy for coping to the SLE might be useful during lockdown measures and may be helpful for other chronic conditions. © 2021 Quartuccio et al.","COVID-19; Psychological distress; Systemic lupus erythematosus","adult; aged; Article; Caucasian; Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale; coping behavior; coronavirus disease 2019; COVID-19 related psychological distress; depression; domestic animal; educational status; environmental factor; family size; female; follow up; General Health Questionnaire; health care facility; health survey; housing; human; Impact of Events Scale; infection control; lockdown; major clinical study; male; middle aged; physical activity; population research; propensity score; psychological aspect; psychological resilience; retrospective study; systemic lupus erythematosus; telemedicine; young adult","","","","","DCTV; Department of cardio-thoracic-vascular Science and public health; Italian Istituto Superiore di Sanità; SANV; Università degli Studi di Padova, UNIPD","The PRESTO (imPact of quaRantine mEasures againST cOvid19) project is a survey that investigated the impact of the Italian government measures adopted between March 9th and May 18th 2020.

This work aims to combine machine learning techniques and data preprocessing for class imbalance to identify the outperforming strategy to screen articles in PubMed for inclusion in systematic reviews. Methods: We trained four binary text classifiers (support vector machines, k-nearest neighbor, random forest, and elastic-net regularized generalized linear models) in combination with four techniques for class imbalance: random undersampling and oversampling with 50:50 and 35:65 positive to negative class ratios and none as a benchmark. We used textual data of 14 systematic reviews as case studies. Difference between cross-validated area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) for machine learning techniques with and without preprocessing (delta AUC) was estimated within each systematic review, separately for each classifier. Meta-Analytic fixed-effect models were used to pool delta AUCs separately by classifier and strategy. Results: Cross-validated AUC-ROC for machine learning techniques (excluding k-nearest neighbor) without preprocessing was prevalently above 90%. Except for k-nearest neighbor, machine learning techniques achieved the best improvement in conjunction with random oversampling 50:50 and random undersampling 35:65. Conclusions: Resampling techniques slightly improved the performance of the investigated machine learning techniques. From a computational perspective, random undersampling 35:65 may be preferred. © 2019 The Author(s).","Classification; Indexed search engine; Machine learning; Systematic review; Text mining; Unbalanced data","article; elastic tissue; human; k nearest neighbor; medical literature; Medline; mining; random forest; receiver operating characteristic; search engine; support vector machine; systematic review; workload","","","","","","","Thomas J., Noel-Storr A., Marshall I., Et al., Living systematic reviews: 2.

This systematic review aims to evaluate and synthesize the growing literature on the use of machine learning (ML) techniques to characterize patient in-bed movements and bedsore development. This review is conducted according to the principles of PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) and is registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO CRD42022314329). The search was performed through nine scientific databases. The review included 78 articles, including 142 ML models. The applied ML models revealed significant heterogeneity in the various methodologies used to identify and classify patient behaviors and postures. The assortment of ML models encompassed artificial neural networks, deep learning architectures, and multimodal sensor integration approaches. This review shows that the models for analyzing and interpreting in-bed movements perform well in experimental settings. Large-scale real-life studies are lacking in diverse patient populations. © 2024 by the authors.","artificial intelligence; in-bed; machine learning; monitoring; prediction; systematic review","","","","","","","","Kristoffersson A., Linden M., A Systematic Review of Wearable Sensors for Monitoring Physical Activity, Sensors, 22, (2022); Majumder S., Mondal T., Deen M.J., Wearable Sensors for Remote Health Monitoring, Sensors, 17, (2017); Ghersi I., Marino M., Miralles M.T., Smart Medical Beds in Patient-Care Environments of the Twenty-First Century: A State-of-Art Survey, BMC Med.

In this work, with an illustrative example on type 2 diabetes we showed how the increasing ability to access and analyzed open data from randomized clinical trials (RCTs) allows to build Machine Learning applications in a framework of personalized medicine. An ensemble machine learning predictive model is first developed and then applied to estimate the expected treatment response according to the medication that would be prescribed. Machine learning is quickly becoming indispensable to bridge science and clinical practice, but it is not sufficient on its own. A collaborative effort is requested to clinicians, statisticians, and computer scientists to strengthen tools built on machine learning to take advantage of this evidence flow. © 2022, The Author(s).","","Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Humans; Machine Learning; Precision Medicine; Treatment Outcome; human; machine learning; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; personalized medicine; treatment outcome","","","","","Investimento Strategico di Dipartimento; Society for Investigative Dermatology, SID; Università degli Studi di Padova, UNIPD, (BIRD175998/17); Centro studi di Economia e Tecnica dell’Energia Giorgio Levi Cases, Università degli Studi di Padova, LC; Dipartimento di Psicologia Generale, Università degli Studi di Padova, DPG","This research was partially funded by an unrestricted grant from the University of Padova (Investimento Strategico di Dipartimento (SID) 2017, BIRD175998/17).

In this report, we focus our attention on the Veneto Region, in the North-East of Italy, which is one of the areas that were first affected by the rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2. We aim to evaluate the trend of all-cause mortality and to give a description of the characteristics of the studied population. Methods: Data used in the analyses were released by the majority of municipalities and cover the 93% of the total population living in the Veneto Region. We evaluated the trend of overall mortality from Jan.01 to Jun.30. 2020. Moreover we compared the COVID-19-related deaths to the overall deaths. Results: From March 2020, the overall mortality rate increased exponentially, affecting males and people aged > 76 the most. The confirmed COVID-19-related death rate in the Veneto region between Mar.01 and Apr.302020 is 30 per 100,000 inhabitants. In contrast, the all-cause mortality increase registered in the same months in the municipalities included in the study is 219 per 100,000 inhabitants. Conclusions: COVID-19 has a primary role in the increase in mortality but does not entirely explain such a high number of deaths. Strategies need to be developed to reduce this gap in case of future waves of the pandemic. © 2021, The Author(s).","COVID-19; Italy; Mortality; Public health burden","Aged; Cities; COVID-19; Disease Outbreaks; Europe; Humans; Italy; Male; Mortality; SARS-CoV-2; aged; city; epidemic; epidemiology; Europe; human; Italy; male; mortality","","","","","","","Livingston E., Bucher K., Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Italy, JAMA, 323, 14, (2020); Gregori D., Azzolina D., Lanera C., Prosepe I., Destro N., Lorenzoni G., Berchialla P., A first estimation of the impact of public health actions against COVID-19 in Veneto (Italy), J Epidemiol Community Health, 74, 10, pp. 858-860, (2020); Grasselli G., Pesenti A., Cecconi M., Critical care utilization for the COVID-19 outbreak in Lombardy, Italy: Early experience and forecast during an emergency response, JAMA, 323, 16, pp. 1545-1546, (2020); Onder G., Rezza G., Brusaferro S., Case-fatality rate and characteristics of patients dying in relation to COVID-19 in Italy, JAMA, (2020); Armocida B., Formenti B., Ussai S., Palestra F., Missoni E., The Italian health system and the COVID-19 challenge, Lancet Public Health, 5, 5, (2020); What Proportion are Asymptomatic?

Food choking represents a considerable public health burden, which might be reduced through increased effective preventative education programs. We present a protocol for a community intervention trial termed CHOP (CHOking Prevention project) that aimed to teach Italian families how to prevent food choking injuries and increase knowledge relating to nutrition. Methods: Italian educational facilities were enrolled. Stratified randomization blocked by geographical area was performed. Each stratum was randomized to one of three different intervention strategies or to a control group. Educational intervention was delivered in the schools by experts and certified trainers as per the following three intervention strategies: directly to families (Strategy A); to teaching staff only, who subsequently delivered the same educational intervention to families (Strategy B); to health service staff only, who then delivered the educational intervention to teaching staff, who subsequently delivered the intervention to families (Strategy C). Participants completed a questionnaire about their knowledge on the topics presented during the educational interventions (pre-, post-, and follow-up of intervention). Information from the questionnaires was synthetized into 6 indicators in order to measure how effective each intervention strategy was. Discussion: The issue of food choking injuries in children is relevant to public health. The protocol we present provides an opportunity to progress towards overcoming such challenges through a working model that can be implemented also in other countries.

Due to the scarcity of lung donors, constructing fair and equitable lung transplant allocation methods is an issue that has been addressed with different strategies worldwide. This work aims to describe how Italy’s “national protocol for the management of surplus organs in all transplant programs” functions through an online app to allocate lung transplants. We have developed two probability models to describe the allocation process among the various transplant centers. An online app was then created. The first model considers conditional probabilities based on a protocol flowchart to compute the probability for each area and transplant center to receive each n-th organ in the period considered. The second probability model is based on the generalization of the binomial distribution to correlated binary variables, which is based on Bahadur’s representation, to compute the cumulative probability for each transplant center to receive at least nth organs. Our results show that the impact of the allocation of a surplus organ depends mostly on the region where the organ was donated. The discrepancies shown by our model may be explained by a discrepancy between the northern and southern regions in relation to the number of organs donated. © 2021 by the authors.

Therefore, patient preference information (PPI) could support the decision-making process, being indisputable for research value, quality, and integrity. However, there is a lack of clear guidance or consensus on the search for preference studies. In this blueprint, an openly available and regularly updated patient preference management system for an integrated database (PPMSDB) that contains the minimal set of data sufficient to provide detailed information for each study (the so-called evidence tables in systematic reviews) and a high-level overview of the findings of a review (summary tables) is described. These tables could help determine which studies, if any, are eligible for quantitative synthesis. Finally, a web platform would provide a graphical and user-friendly interface. On the other hand, a set of APIs (application programming interfaces) would also be developed and provided. The PPMSDB, aims to collect preference measures, characteristics, and meta-data, and allow researchers to obtain a quick overview of a research field, use the latest evidence, and identify research gaps. In conjunction with proper statistical analysis of quantitative preference measures, these aspects can facilitate formal evidence-based decisions and adequate consideration when conducting a structured decision-making process. Our objective is to outline the conceptual infrastructure necessary to build and maintain a successful network that can monitor the currentness and validity of evidence. © 2022 by the authors.","analytic infrastructure; PPI; PPMSDB; systematic reviews","","","","","","","","Mackian S., Up the Garden Path and over the Edge: Where Might Health-Seeking Behaviour Take Us?, Health Policy Plan, 19, pp. 137-146, (2004); Cornally N., McCarthy G., Help-Seeking Behaviour: A Concept Analysis: Help-Seeking Behaviour: A Concept Analysis, Int.

Setting The Aggregate Analysis of ClinicalTrials.gov (AACT) database, reflecting ClinicalTrials.gov as of 27 March 2016. Design The AACT database was searched for all cardiovascular clinical trials that started from January 2006 up to December 2015. Results Thirteen thousand and seven hundred twenty-nine cardiovascular trials were identified. Of these, 8900 (65%) were classified as closed studies. Globally, 11% of closed trials were terminated. This proportion varied from 9.6% to 14% for trials recruiting from Europe and Americas, respectively, with a slightly decreasing trend (p=0.02) over the study period. The most common reason for trials failing to complete was poor accrual (41%). Intercontinental trials exhibited lower figures of poor accrual as the reason for their early stopping, as compared with trials recruiting in a single continent (28% vs 44%, p=0.002). Conclusions Poor accrual significantly challenges the successful completion of cardiovascular clinical trials. Findings are suggestive of a positive effect of globalisation of cardiovascular clinical research on the achievement of enrolment goals within a reasonable time frame. © 2017 Article author(s).

We present the results from the CHOP (CHOking Prevention) project community intervention trial, which aimed to compare three different school-based intervention strategies for food choking prevention. The trial enrolled 41 educational facilities, which were randomized to one of three different intervention strategies to inform about prevention of food choking, or to serve as the control group. In strategy A, education was delivered directly to families, whereas in strategy B, education was delivered first to teachers and by them to families, and in strategy C, education was delivered only to healthcare coordinators in each school and by them to teachers and families. All educational interventions were delivered in the schools by experts and certified trainers. The participants were asked about sociodemographic information and completed questionnaires (pre-, post- and follow-up of intervention). Information from the postintervention and follow-up questionnaires was synthesized into four indicators to evaluate the effectiveness of each intervention strategy. Of the 1,426 participants, 298 were involved in strategy A, 474 in strategy B, 491 in strategy C and 163 in the control group. At postintervention, the scores of the indicators in each strategy significantly outperformed those of the control group, with adjusted p < 0.05. At follow-up, the distribution of the indicator scores of each strategy was found to be not significantly different compared to those of the control group (p > 0.05). The results of this study suggest that a sustainable school-based public health intervention mediated by teachers is effective as direct training for families in improving knowledge about food choking injury prevention. Nevertheless, further improvements could be made to increase long-term information retention. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","children; choking prevention; CHOP; community intervention trial; foreign body; public health; school","Airway Obstruction; Child; Child, Preschool; Humans; Schools; Surveys and Questionnaires; airway obstruction; child; human; preschool child; questionnaire; school","","","","","Italian Ministry of Health, Directorate General for Food Hygiene and Safety and Nutrition","This work is supported by an unrestricted grant from the Italian Ministry of Health, Directorate General for Food Hygiene and Safety and Nutrition.

The GISC project is an ongoing study that takes place in the region of Puglia, Southern Italy. Patients with a diagnosis of heart failure are enrolled in a long-term assistance program that includes the adoption of an online platform for data sharing between general practitioners and cardiologists working in hospitals and community health districts. Logistic regression, generalized linear model net (GLMN), classification and regression tree, random forest, adaboost, logitboost, support vector machine, and neural networks were applied to evaluate the feasibility of such techniques in predicting hospitalization of 380 patients enrolled in the GISC study, using data about demographic characteristics, medical history, and clinical characteristics of each patient. The MLTs were compared both without and with missing data imputation. Overall, models trained without missing data imputation showed higher predictive performances. TheGLMNshowed better performance in predicting hospitalization than the other MLTs, with an average accuracy, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of 81.2%, 87.5%, and 75%, respectively. Present findings suggest that MLTs may represent a promising opportunity to predict hospital admission of heart failure patients by exploiting health care information generated by the contact of such patients with the health care system. © 2019 by the authors.

Although the method primarily serves as an automated indexing tool, facilitating organization and access to relevant reports, monographs, and specifications, it significantly enhances the efficiency of navigating the extensive JECFA database. Researchers can then perform more targeted and efficient searches, although additional manual steps are required to extract and structure the detailed toxicological data. We developed R programming scripts to extract key information, such as chemical names, identifiers, and evaluation reports, from JECFA web pages. The resulting data set comprises 6552 records as of May 2024. We validated the dataset through a systematic comparison with manually collected data, ensuring its reliability. Instructions and code for accessing and processing the dataset, facilitating its reuse in research are provided. The code and dataset are openly available, enabling researchers to efficiently access and analyze toxicological data from the JECFA database. © The Author(s) 2024.","","Databases, Factual; Food Additives; United Nations; World Health Organization; food additive; factual database; United Nations; World Health Organization","","Food Additives, ","","","José Cortiñas Abrahantes; European Food Safety Authority, EFSA; World Health Organization, WHO, (202401573, OC/EFSA/MESE/2022/03 – CT02); World Health Organization, WHO","The authors acknowledge the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) database as the original source of the data used in this study.

Computational models and artificial intelligence (AI) are new technological tools that could offer a significant improvement in our ability to predict MAEs. In this proof-of-concept study, we propose a deep learning (DL)-based model, which we termed Deep ARrhythmic Prevention in dilated cardiomyopathy (DARP-D), built using multidimensional cardiac magnetic resonance data (cine videos and hypervideos and LGE images and hyperimages) and clinical covariates, aimed at predicting and tracking an individual patient’s risk curve of MAEs (including sudden cardiac death, cardiac arrest due to ventricular fibrillation, sustained ventricular tachycardia lasting >30 s or causing haemodynamic collapse in <30 s, appropriate implantable cardiac defibrillator intervention) over time. The model was trained and validated in 70% of a sample of 154 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy and tested in the remaining 30%. DARP-D achieved a 95% CI in Harrell’s C concordance indices of 0.12–0.68 on the test set. We demonstrate that our DL approach is feasible and represents a novelty in the field of arrhythmic risk prediction in dilated cardiomyopathy, able to analyze cardiac motion, tissue characteristics, and baseline covariates to predict an individual patient’s risk curve of major arrhythmic events. However, the low number of patients, MAEs and epoch of training make the model a promising prototype but not ready for clinical usage. Further research is needed to improve, stabilize and validate the performance of the DARP-D to convert it from an AI experiment to a daily used tool. © 2024 Corianò et al.

The study involved patients admitted to PICUs between 2010 and 2020. Data were extracted from the Italian Network of Pediatric Intensive Care Units (TIPNet) registry. The algorithms considered were generalized linear model (GLM), recursive partition tree (RPART), random forest (RF), neural networks models, and extreme gradient boosting (XGB). Since the outcome is rare, upsampling and downsampling algorithms have been applied for imbalance control. For each approach, the main performance measures were reported. Among an overall sample of 29, 494 subjects, only 399 developed HF during the PICU stay. The median age was about two years, and the male gender was the most prevalent. The XGB algorithm outperformed other MLTs in predicting HF development, with a median ROC measure of 0.780 (IQR 0.770-0.793). PIM 3, age, and base excess were found to be the strongest predictors of outcome. The present work provides insights for the prediction of HF development during PICU stay using machine-learning algorithms. © 2021 by the authors.","Hemodynamic failure; Imbalance management; Machine learning techniques; Outcome prediction; Picu","","","","","","","","Hsu D.T., Pearson G.D., Heart Failure in Children, Circ.

Currently there is little knowledge about prognostic factors for unfavorable outcome at long term follow-up; furthermore, there is also little knowledge about the genetics of these patients. Aims: This observational and retrospective study describes long-term cardiovascular outcomes of a population affected by SCAD and assesses predictors of recurrent de novo SCAD and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). Furthermore, a correlation between genotype and adverse events at follow-up was sought. Methods: Baseline characteristics, angiographic features, use of medication and long-term cardiovascular events were systematically ascertained between 2000 and 2019. Next generation sequencing was performed with a panel consisting of twenty genes of interest. Variants found were filtered based on their frequency and only frequencies <1% in the general population were considered as “positive”. Results: Seventy patients were enrolled and followed for a median time of 39.1 months. Median age was 52 years and the majority were women (86%). Use of hormone therapy (HT) (OR 3.64, p = 0.041) and presence of malignant ventricular arrhythmias (VAs) at onset (OR 7.03, p = 0.0073) were associated with a greater risk of recurrent de novo SCAD. Proximal type SCAD (OR 8.47, p < 0.0001) and presence of VAs at onset (OR 9.97, p = 0.047) were associated with a greater risk of MACE. A potential SCAD-associated mutation was detected in 27 patients (44%); 6 patients (22%) defined as genetically “positive” developed MACE vs. 2 patients (6%) defined as “negative” (p = 0.06 at univariate analysis). MACE at follow-up is reached earlier in genetically positive patients (7.9 vs. 42.5 months). Conclusion: use of HT and VAs at SCAD onset are prognostic factors for recurrent de novo SCAD. Proximal SCAD site and VAs at SCAD onset were prognostic factors for MACE. Analysis by molecular genetics seems to be a promising tool for the possible additional role it could play in MACE prediction. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Coronary; Dissection; Genetics; SCAD; Spontaneous","Coronary Angiography; Coronary Vessel Anomalies; Coronary Vessels; Dissection; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Prognosis; Retrospective Studies; Vascular Diseases; ACTA2 gene; adult; age distribution; Article; cardiovascular disease; cardiovascular risk factor; CBS gene; clinical feature; clinical outcome; cohort analysis; COL3A1 gene; COL5A1 gene; COL5A2 gene; controlled study; coronary angiography; coronary artery dissection; disease course; ELN gene; FBN1 gene; FBN2 gene; female; follow up; gene; gene identification; gene mutation; genetic analysis; genetic variability; genotype; heart ventricle arrhythmia; high throughput sequencing; hormonal therapy; human; long term care; LTBP2 gene; major clinical study; male; middle aged; molecular genetics; MYH11 gene; MYLK gene; NOTCH1 gene; observational study; odds ratio; PLOD1 gene; population research; prediction; prognosis; recurrent disease; retrospective study; sex difference; SLC2A10 gene; SMAD3 gene; SMAD4 gene; TGFB2 gene; TGFB3 gene; TGFBR1 gene; TGFBR2 gene; univariate analysis; coronary blood vessel; coronary vessel malformation; diagnostic imaging; dissection; vascular disease","","","","","","","Adlam D., Et al., European Society of Cardiology, acute cardiovascular care association, SCAD study group: a position paper on spontaneous coronary artery dissection, Eur.

Naïve Bayes, Bayesian Additive Regression Trees and Bayesian Networks implemented using a Greedy Thick Thinning algorithm for learning dependencies among variables and EM algorithm for learning conditional probabilities associated to each variable are taken into account. Three sets of variables were considered: (i) disease characteristics: presentation, behavior and location (ii) risk factors: age, gender, smoke and familiarity and (iii) genetic polymorphisms of the NOD2, CD14, TNFA, IL12B, and IL1RN genes, whose involvement in Crohn's disease is known or suspected. Extra-intestinal manifestations occurred in 75 patients. Bayesian Networks achieved accuracy of 82% when considering only clinical factors and 89% when considering also genetic information, outperforming the other techniques. CD14 has a small predicting capability. Adding TNFA, IL12B to the 3020insC NOD2 variant improved the accuracy.","Clinical Decision Support; Clinical research informatics; Data mining and statistical data analysis","Algorithms; Bayes Theorem; Crohn Disease; Data Mining; Female; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Humans; Machine Learning; Male; Models, Statistical; Polymorphism, Genetic; Risk Factors; algorithm; Bayes theorem; complication; Crohn disease; data mining; female; genetic polymorphism; genetic predisposition; genetics; human; machine learning; male; risk factor; statistical model","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1942597X","","","28269885","English","AMIA Annu Symp Proc","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85027513206"

In this study, the feasibility and acceptability of using commercial WDs in elderly patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) or surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) will be explored. This is a prospective observational study. Participants were trained to use a WD and a smartphone to collect data on their physical activity, rest heart rate and number of hours of sleep. Validated questionnaires were also used to evaluate these outcomes. A technology acceptance questionnaire was used at the end of the follow up. In our participants an overall good compliance in wearing the device (75.1% vs. 79.8%, SAVR vs. TAVR) was assessed. Half of the patients were willing to continue using the device. Perceived ease of use is one of the domains that scored higher in the technology acceptance questionnaire. In this study we observed that the use of a WD is accepted in our frail population for an extended period. Even though commercial WDs are not tailored for clinical research, they can produce useful information on patient behavior, especially when coordinated with intervention tailored to the single patient. © 2021 by the authors.

A computer-assisted telephone interview was conducted in 2012 and 2016, employing the same procedures. The difference in outcomes between 2012 and 2016 was assessed using a logistic regression model. One hundred and sixty-seven subjects responded to both the 2012 and 2016 survey editions (respondents). For both the unadjusted and adjusted analyses, the respondents in 2016 were more likely to be involved in a programme to lose weight and to consider food labelling the most effective intervention introduced to date to promote healthy nutrition. However, no significant differences were reported in both self-reported and objectively assessed understandings of front-of-pack-labelling. Evidence suggests a positive perception among Chileans regarding the effectiveness of the new law. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","attitudes; Chilean population; Chilean regulation; Front-of-pack-labelling","Adult; Consumer Behavior; Diet, Healthy; Female; Food; Food Labeling; Health Behavior; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Surveys and Questionnaires; adult; advertising; article; body weight; Chilean; consumer; female; food packaging; human; human experiment; major clinical study; male; nutrition; outcome assessment; perception; telephone interview; consumer attitude; food; health behavior; middle aged; questionnaire","","","","","","","Campos S., Doxey J., Hammond D., Nutrition labels on pre-packaged foods: a systematic review, Public Health Nutr, 14, pp. 1496-1506, (2011); Cecchini M., Warin L., Impact of food labelling systems on food choices and eating behaviours: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized studies, Obes Rev, 17, pp. 201-210, (2016); Cochero M.A., Rivera-Dommarco J., Popkin B.M., Ng S.W., Mexico, evidence of sustained consumer response two years after implementing a sugar-sweetened beverage tax, (2017); Cowburn G., Stockley L., Consumer understanding and use of nutrition labelling: a systematic review, Public Health Nutr, 8, pp. 21-28, (2005); Franck C., Grandi S.M., Eisenberg M.J., Taxing junk food to counter obesity, Am J Public Health, 103, pp. 1949-1953, (2013); Gregori D., Ballali S., Vogele C., Galasso F., Widhalm K., Berchialla P., Baldi I., What is the value given by consumers to nutritional label information?

Aims: The present study aimed to analyze the relationship between serum Mg and in-hospital mortality (IHM) in patients admitted to the medical ward of two hospitals in the Veneto region (Italy). Methods: Patients > 18 years hospitalized in the medical wards of the hospitals of Vittorio Veneto and Conegliano, Italy (from January 12, 2011, through December 27, 2016) with at least one measurement of serum Mg were included in the study. A logistic regression model was used to assess the unadjusted and adjusted (by age, gender, Charlson Comorbidity index, discharge diagnosis’ class) association of serum Mg and IHM. Results: In total 5024 patients were analyzed, corresponding to 6980 total admissions. The unadjusted analysis showed that IHM risk was significantly higher with 0.2 mg/dl incremental serum Mg level change from 2.4 mg/dl to 2.6, (OR 1.71 95% CI 1.55–1.89) and with 0.2 mg/dl change from serum Mg level of 1.4 mg/dl to 1.2 mg/dl, (OR 1.28 95% CI 1.17–1.40). Such results were confirmed at adjusted analysis. Discussion: Present findings have relevant implications for the clinical management of patients suffering from medical conditions, highlighting the need for analyzing Mg concentration carefully. Conclusions: Serum Mg levels seem to be a good predictor of IHM. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Elderly; Hospitalization; Medical ward; Mortality; Serum magnesium","Aged; Aged, 80 and over;

A better understanding of the epidemiological implications of the different models seems crucial for tailoring prevention policies. This study aims to explore the concordance and discrepancies in outbreak prediction produced by models implemented and used in the first wave of the epidemic. To evaluate the performance of the model, an analysis was carried out on Italian pandemic data from February 24, 2020. The epidemic models were fitted to data collected at 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, and 98 days (the entire time series). At each time step, we made predictions until May 31, 2020. The Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) were calculated. The GAM model is the most suitable parameterization for predicting the number of new cases; exponential or Poisson models help predict the cumulative number of cases. When the goal is to predict the epidemic peak, GAM, ARIMA, or Bayesian models are preferable. However, the prediction of the pandemic peak could be made carefully during the early stages of the epidemic because the forecast is affected by high uncertainty and may very likely produce the wrong results. © 2023 by the authors.","COVID-19; early phase; epidemic models; prediction model; prevention policy","","","","","","","","Morettini M., Sbrollini A., Marcantoni I., Burattini L., COVID-19 in Italy: Dataset of the Italian Civil Protection Department, Data Brief, 30, (2020); Du S., Wang J., Zhang H., Cui W., Kang Z., Yang T., Lou B., Chi Y., Long H., Ma M., Et al., Predicting COVID-19 Using Hybrid AI Model, SSRN Electron.

A variety of data, including textual sources, can be fruitfully exploited. Dealing with unstructured data necessitates the use of methods for automatic data-driven variable construction and machine learning techniques (MLT) show promising results. In this framework, varicella-zoster virus (VZV) infection was chosen to perform an automatic case identification with MLT. Pedianet, an Italian pediatric primary care database, was used to train a series of models to identify whether a child was diagnosed with VZV infection between 2004 and 2014 in the Veneto region, starting from free text fields. Given the nature of the task, a recurrent neural network (RNN) with bidirectional gated recurrent units (GRUs) was chosen; the same models were then used to predict the children’s status for the following years. A gold standard produced by manual extraction for the same interval was available for comparison. RNN-GRU improved its performance over time, reaching the maximum value of area under the ROC curve (AUC-ROC) of 95.30% at the end of the period. The absolute bias in estimates of VZV infection was below 1.5% in the last five years analyzed. The findings in this study could assist the large-scale use of EHRs for clinical outcome predictive modeling and help establish high-performance systems in other medical domains. © 2022 by the authors.

Emergency department (ED) diagnoses are a useful source of information for injury epidemiological surveillance purposes. However, ED data collection systems often use free-text fields to report patient diagnoses. Machine learning techniques (MLTs) are powerful tools for automatic text classification. The MLT system is useful to improve injury surveillance by speeding up the manual free-text coding tasks of ED diagnoses. Objective: This research aims to develop a tool for automatic free-text classification of ED diagnoses to automatically identify injury cases. The automatic classification system also serves for epidemiological purposes to identify the burden of pediatric injuries in Padua, a large province in the Veneto region in the Northeast Italy. Methods: The study includes 283, 468 pediatric admissions between 2007 and 2018 to the Padova University Hospital ED, a large referral center in Northern Italy. Each record reports a diagnosis by free text. The records are standard tools for reporting patient diagnoses. An expert pediatrician manually classified a randomly extracted sample of approximately 40, 000 diagnoses. This study sample served as the gold standard to train an MLT classifier. After preprocessing, a document-term matrix was created. The machine learning classifiers, including decision tree, random forest, gradient boosting method (GBM), and support vector machine (SVM), were tuned by 4-fold cross-validation. The injury diagnoses were classified into 3 hierarchical classification tasks, as follows: injury versus noninjury (task A), intentional versus unintentional injury (task B), and type of unintentional injury (task C), according to the World Health Organization classification of injuries. Results: The SVM classifier achieved the highest performance accuracy (94.14%) in classifying injury versus noninjury cases (task A). The GBM method produced the best results (92% accuracy) for the unintentional and intentional injury classification task (task B). The highest accuracy for the unintentional injury subclassification (task C) was achieved by the SVM classifier. The SVM, random forest, and GBM algorithms performed similarly against the gold standard across different tasks. Conclusions: This study shows that MLTs are promising techniques for improving epidemiological surveillance, allowing for the automatic classification of pediatric ED free-text diagnoses. The MLTs revealed a suitable classification performance, especially for general injuries and intentional injury classification. This automatic classification could facilitate the epidemiological surveillance of pediatric injuries by also reducing the health professionals' efforts in manually classifying diagnoses for research purposes. © 2023 The Author(s).

We conducted a prospective observational study in children with CHD who underwent cardiac surgery within five years of age. At least 18 months after cardiac surgery, we performed an extensive neuropsychological (intelligence, language, attention, executive function, memory, social skills) and psychopathological assessment, implementing a machine-learning approach for clustering and influencing variable classification. We examined 74 children (37 with CHD and 37 age-matched controls). Group comparisons have shown differences in many domains: intelligence, language, executive skills, and memory. From CHD questionnaires, we identified two clinical subtypes of psychopathological profiles: a small subgroup with high symptoms of psychopathology and a wider subgroup of patients with ADHD-like profiles. No associations with the considered clinical parameters were found. CHD patients are prone to high interindividual variability in neuropsychological and psychological outcomes, depending on many factors that are difficult to control and study. Unfortunately, these dysfunctions are under-recognized by clinicians. Given that brain maturation continues through childhood, providing a significant window for recovery, there is a need for a lifespan approach to optimize the outcome trajectory for patients with CHD. © 2021, The Author(s).","","Cardiac Surgical Procedures; Cognition; Heart Defects, Congenital; Humans; Machine Learning; Prospective Studies; Surveys and Questionnaires; cognition; congenital heart malformation; heart surgery; human; machine learning; pathophysiology; physiology; procedures; prospective study; questionnaire","","","","","Ministero dell’Istruzione, dell’Università e della Ricerca, MIUR; Università degli Studi di Padova, UNIPD","The present work was carried out within the scope of the research program Dipartimenti di Eccellenza (art.1, commi 314–337 legge 232/2016), which was supported by a grant from MIUR to the Department of General Psychology, University of Padua.","Hoffman J.I.E., Kaplan S., The incidence of congenital heart disease, J.

Machine learning techniques are useful for analyzing narratives, but they have been used mostly for English-language data sets. Considering such a framework, the performance of an ML classification task of a Spanish-language ED visits database was tested. ED visits collected in the EDs of nine hospitals in Nicaragua were analyzed. Spanish-language, free-text discharge diagnoses were considered in the analysis. Five-hundred random forests were trained on a set of bootstrap samples of the whole data set (1,789 ED visits) to perform the classification task. For each one, after having identified optimal parameter value, the final validated model was trained on the whole bootstrapped data set and tested. The classification accuracies had a median of 0.783 (95% CI [0.779, 0.796]). Machine learning techniques seemed to be a promising opportunity for the exploitation of unstructured information reported in ED records in low- and middle-income Spanish-speaking countries. © The Author(s) 2019.","classification task;

Methods: Population-based cohort study using resources from the “Martignacco project” started in 1977 and promoted by the WHO. Three thousand and sixty-six subjects were involved in the project with follow-up through December 2014. Estimates were made for age-specific incidence rates for the first hospitalization for HF by birth cohort, calendar period, and gender. To disentangle the effects of age, calendar period, and birth cohort on the overall temporal trend in HF, we performed an age-period-cohort (APC) analysis. Results: An incident hospitalization for HF was reported for 427 subjects. In the APC model, a cohort effect with a turning point in 1930 was observed. After 1930, a sharp decrease in the rate ratios (RRs) occurred in among both genders. The estimated RR in the 1940 birth cohort decreased to 0.43, (95% CI 0.19–0.92), in men and to 0.45, (95% CI 0.16–1.26), in women. A residual effect of calendar period on RR was observed with a plateau in 1995 for women and in 2000 for men, followed by a decline. Conclusions: The current findings showed that HF hospitalization incidence has declined over the period considered in subjects over 65 years living in a geographically defined community in Northeast Italy. Moreover, the age of birth, calendar period of diagnosis, and birth cohort play an important role in the incidence of the first hospitalization for HF. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","APC analysis; Heart failure; Incidence","Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Cohort Studies; Female; Heart Failure; Hospitalization; Humans; Italy; Male; Middle Aged; Population Surveillance; Residence Characteristics; Time Factors; adult; aged; Article; cohort analysis; controlled study; female; follow up; groups by age; heart failure; hospital discharge; hospitalization; human; incidence; major clinical study; male; middle aged; priority journal; sex difference; trend study; very elderly; demography; health survey; heart failure; hospitalization; Italy; procedures; time factor; trends","","","","","Università degli Studi di Padova, UNIPD, (CPDA134045/13)","This work was partially supported by an unrestricted grant from the University of Padova , Progetti di Ateneo 2013 (Code CPDA134045/13 , “The role of comorbidity, disability and polypharmacy in the care of patients with heart failure”).

Despite technological improvements, patients often need to undergo generator replacement, which entails the risk of periprocedural complications. Our aim was to estimate the service life of ICDs over a 10-year interval and to assess the main causes of replacement on the basis of data from the National ICD Registry of the Italian Society of Arrhythmology and Cardiac Pacing (AIAC). Methods and Results: The registry includes data from over 400 hospitals in Italy. We included all patients who underwent device replacement from calendar years 2007 to 2016. The median service life of the ICDs and its trend over the years was estimated across the 3 types of devices (single-chamber, dual-chamber, cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator) and the indication to implantation. The causes of replacement were also analyzed. We included 29 158 records from 27 676 patients (80.9% men; mean age at device replacement 65.8±12.0 years). The median service life was 57.3 months (interquartile range 27.8 months). Over the years, service life showed an increasing trend. The majority of patients underwent elective replacement because of battery end of life, and over the years there was a significant reduction of replacement for recalls, erosion/infections, and cardiac resynchronization therapy upgrading. Conclusions: Our data from a large single-nation population showed that the trend of ICD service life, independently from ICD type, indication, and settings, significantly improved over time. Moreover, there was a striking reduction of interventions for upgrading and infection/erosion. This favorable trend has important clinical, organizational, and financial implications. © 2019 The Authors.

In recent years, there has been widespread use of the technique in the cardiothoracic surgery literature to evaluate to potential benefits of new surgical therapies or procedures. However, the small sample size and the strong dependence of the treatment assignment on the baseline covariates that often characterize these studies make such an evaluation challenging from a statistical point of view. In such settings, the use of propensity score matching in combination with oversampling and replacement may provide a solution to these issues by increasing the initial sample size of the study and thus improving the statistical power that is needed to detect the effect of interest. In this study, we review the use of propensity score matching in combination with oversampling and replacement in small sample size settings. Methods: We performed a series of Monte Carlo simulations to evaluate how the sample size, the proportion of treated, and the assignment mechanism affect the performances of the proposed approaches. We assessed the performances with overall balance, relative bias, root mean squared error and nominal coverage. Moreover, we illustrate the methods using a real case study from the cardiac surgery literature. Results: Matching without replacement produced estimates with lower bias and better nominal coverage than matching with replacement when 1:1 matching was considered. In contrast to that, matching with replacement showed better balance, relative bias, and root mean squared error than matching without replacement for increasing levels of oversampling. The best nominal coverage was obtained by using the estimator that accounts for uncertainty in the matching procedure on sets of units obtained after matching with replacement. Conclusions: The use of replacement provides the most reliable treatment effect estimates and that no more than 1 or 2 units from the control group should be matched to each treated observation. Moreover, the variance estimator that accounts for the uncertainty in the matching procedure should be used to estimate the treatment effect. © 2021, The Author(s).","Monte Carlo simulations; Oversampling; Propensity score matching; Replacement; Small samples","Bias; Humans; Monte Carlo Method; Propensity Score; Sample Size; human; Monte Carlo method; propensity score; sample size; statistical bias","","","","","","","Austin P.C., An Introduction to Propensity Score Methods for Reducing the Effects of Confounding in Observational Studies, Multivariate Behavioral Research, 46, pp. 399-424, (2011); Ensminger S., Fujita B., Bauer T., Mollmann H., Beckmann A., Bekeredjian R., Et al., Rapid Deployment Versus Conventional Bioprosthetic Valve Replacement for Aortic Stenosis, J Am Coll Cardiol, 71, pp. 1417-1428, (2018); Fraser C.D., Zhou X., Palepu S., Lui C., Suarez-Pierre A., Crawford T.C., Et al., Tricuspid Valve Detachment in Ventricular Septal Defect Closure Does Not Impact Valve Function, Ann Thorac Surg, (2018); Park D.-W., Seung K.B., Kim Y.-H., Lee J.-Y., Kim W.-J., Kang S.-J., Et al., Long-Term Safety and Efficacy of Stenting Versus Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting for Unprotected Left Main Coronary Artery Disease: 5-Year Results From the MAIN-COMPARE (Revascularization for Unprotected Left Main Coronary Artery Stenosis: Comparison of Percutaneous Coronary Angioplasty Versus Surgical Revascularization) Registry, J Am College Cardiol, 56, pp. 117-124, (2010); Bejko J., Toto F., Gregori D., Gerosa G., Bottio T., Left ventricle assist devices and driveline’s infection incidence: a single-centre experience, J Artif Organs, 21, pp. 52-60, (2018); D'Onofrio A., Salizzoni S., Filippini C., Tessari C., Bagozzi L., Messina A., Et al., Surgical aortic valve replacement with new-generation bioprostheses: Sutureless versus rapid-deployment, J Thoracic Cardiovasc Surg, 159, pp. 432-442.e1, (2020); Colli A., Carrozzini M., Francescato A., Galuppo M., Comisso M., Toto F., Et al., Acute DeBakey Type I aortic dissection without intimal tear in the arch: is total arch replacement the right choice?, Interact Cardiovasc Thorac Surg, 26, pp. 84-90, (2018); Colli A., Carrozzini M., Galuppo M., Comisso M., Toto F., Gregori D., Et al., Analysis of early and long-term outcomes of acute type A aortic dissection according to the new international aortic arch surgery study group recommendations, Heart Vessels, 31, pp. 1616-1624, (2016); Shi W.Y., Moreno-Betancur M., Nugent A.W., Cheung M., Colan S., Turner C., Et al., Long-Term Outcomes of Childhood Left Ventricular Non-Compaction Cardiomyopathy: Results from a National Population-Based Study, Circulation, (2018); Carrozzini M., Bejko J., Guariento A., Rubino M., Bianco R., Tarzia V., Et al., Minimally Invasive Implantation of Continuous Flow Left Ventricular Assist Devices: The Evolution of Surgical Techniques in a Single-Center Experience, Artif Organs, 43, pp. E41-E52, (2019); Toumpoulis I.K., Anagnostopoulos C.E., Katritsis D.G., DeRose J.J., Swistel D.G., The impact of preoperative thrombolysis on long-term survival after coronary artery bypass grafting, Circulation, 112, (2005); Boening A., Friedrich C., Hedderich J., Schoettler J., Fraund S., Cremer J.T., Early and medium-term results after on-pump and off-pump coronary artery surgery: a propensity score analysis, The Annals of Thoracic Surgery, 76, pp. 2000-2006, (2003); Bejko J., Pittarello D., Falasco G., Di Gregorio G., Tarzia V., Rizzoli G., Et al., A pilot study on the efficacy and safety of a minimally invasive surgical and anesthetic approach for ventricular assist device implantation, Int J Artif Organs, (2017); Rubin D.B., Estimating Causal Effects of Treatments in Randomized and Nonrandomized Studies, Journal of Educational Psychology, (1974); Rosenbaum P.R., Rubin D.B., The Central Role of the Propensity Score in Observational Studies for Causal Effects, Biometrika, 70, pp. 41-55, (1983); Rosenbaum P.R., Rubin D.B., Constructing a Control Group Using Multivariate Matched Sampling Methods That Incorporate the Propensity Score, The American Statistician, 39, pp. 33-38, (1985); Gu X.S., Rosenbaum P.R., Comparison of Multivariate Matching Methods: Structures, Distances, and Algorithms, Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics, 2, pp. 405-420, (1993); Ming K., Rosenbaum P.R., Substantial Gains in Bias Reduction from Matching with a Variable Number of Controls, Biometrics, 56, pp. 118-124, (2000); Austin P.C., Some Methods of Propensity-Score Matching had Superior Performance to Others: Results of an Empirical Investigation and Monte Carlo simulations, Biometrical Journal, 51, pp. 171-184, (2009); Austin P.C., A comparison of 12 algorithms for matching on the propensity score, Statistics in Medicine., 33, pp. 1057-1069, (2014); Imbens G.W., Nonparametric Estimation of Average Treatment Effects under Exogeneity: A Review.

The effects of pollution on atrial fibrillation (AF) beyond the first several hours of exposure remain controversial. A total of 145 patients with implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs), cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillators (ICD-CRT), or pacemakers were enrolled in this multicentric prospective study. Daily levels of PM2.5 and PM10 were collected from monitoring stations within 20 km of the patient’s residence. A Firth Logistic Regression model was used to evaluate the association between AF and daily exposure to PM2.5 and PM10 . Exposure levels to PM2.5 and PM10 were moderate, being above the World Health Organization (WHO) PM2.5 and PM10 thresholds of 25 µg/m3 and 50 µg/m3, respectively, on 26% and 18% of the follow-up days. An association was found between daily levels of PM2.5 and PM10 and AF (95% confidence intervals (CIs) of 1.34–2.40 and 1.44–4.28, respectively) for an increase of 50 µg/m3 above the WHO threshold. Daily exposure to moderate PM2.5 and PM10 levels is associated with AF in patients who are not prone to AF. © 2020 by the authors.

This study aims to characterize a possible source of extravariability in the number of hospitalizations for COVID-19 by considering age at admission as a potential explanatory factor. Age at hospitalization provides a clear idea of the epidemiological impact of the disease, as the elderly population is more at risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes. Administrative data for the Veneto region, Northern Italy from February 1, 2020, to November 20, 2021, were considered. Methods: An inferential approach based on quasi-likelihood estimates through the generalized estimation equation (GEE) Poisson link function was used to quantify the overdispersion. The daily variation in the number of hospitalizations in the Veneto region that lagged at 3, 7, 10, and 15 days was associated with the number of news items retrieved from Global Database of Events, Language, and Tone (GDELT) regarding containment interventions to determine whether the magnitude of the past variation in daily hospitalizations could impact the number of preventive policies. Results: This study demonstrated a significant increase in the pattern of hospitalizations for COVID-19 in Veneto beginning in December 2020. Age at admission affected the excess variability in the number of admissions. This effect increased as age increased. Specifically, the dispersion was significantly lower in people under 30 years of age. From an epidemiological point of view, controlling the overdispersion of hospitalizations and the variables characterizing this phenomenon is crucial. In this context, the policies should prevent the spread of the virus in particular in the elderly, as the uncontrolled diffusion in this age group would result in an extra variability in daily hospitalizations. Discussion: This study demonstrated that the overdispersion, together with the increase in hospitalizations, results in a lagged inflation of the containment policies. However, all these interventions represent strategies designed to contain a mechanism that has already been triggered. Further efforts should be directed toward preventive policies aimed at protecting the most fragile subjects, such as the elderly. Therefore, it is essential to implement containment strategies before the occurrence of potentially out-of-control situations, resulting in congestion in hospitals and health services.

Methods that target the marginal odds ratio, allowing for improved precision and power, have been devel-oped. Methods: The performance of different estimators for the treatment effect in the frequentist (targeted maximum likelihood estimator, inverse-probability-of-treatment weighting, parametric G-computation, and the semiparametric locally efficient estimator) and Bayesian (model averaging), adjustment for confounding, and generalized Bayesian causal effect estimation frameworks are assessed and compared in a simulation study under different scenarios. The use of these estimators is illustrated on an RCT in type II diabetes. Results: Model mis-specification does not increase the bias. The approaches that are not doubly robust have increased standard error (SE) under the scenario of mis-specification of the treatment model. The Bayesian estimators showed a higher type II error than frequentist estimators if noisy covariates are included in the treatment model. Conclusions: Adjusting for prognostic baseline covariates in the analysis of RCTs can have more power than intention-to-treat based tests. However, for some classes of model, when the regression model is mis-specified, inflated type I error and potential bias on treatment effect estimate may arise. © 2021 by the authors.

Hence, current literature recommends the inclusion of clinical trial registries in systematic reviews (SRs). This study aims to provide an automated approach to extend a search on PubMed to the ClinicalTrials.gov database, relying on text mining and machine learning techniques. Study Design and Setting: The procedure starts from a literature search on PubMed. Next, it considers the training of a classifier that can identify documents with a comparable word characterization in the ClinicalTrials.gov clinical trial repository. Fourteen SRs, covering a broad range of health conditions, are used as case studies for external validation. A cross-validated support-vector machine (SVM) model was used as the classifier. Results: The sensitivity was 100% in all SRs except one (87.5%), and the specificity ranged from 97.2% to 99.9%. The ability of the instrument to distinguish on-topic from off-topic articles ranged from an area under the receiver operator characteristic curve of 93.4% to 99.9%. Conclusion: The proposed machine learning instrument has the potential to help researchers identify relevant studies in the SR process by reducing workload, without losing sensitivity and at a small price in terms of specificity. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Clinical trial registry; Indexed search engine; Machine learning; Meta-analysis; Systematic review; Text mining","Clinical Trials as Topic; Data Mining; Humans; Information Storage and Retrieval; Machine Learning; Meta-Analysis as Topic; PubMed; Search Engine; Sensitivity and Specificity; Systematic Reviews as Topic; article; clinical trial (topic); diagnostic test accuracy study; human; Medline; mining; scientist; search engine; sensitivity and specificity; support vector machine; systematic review; validation process; workload; data mining; information retrieval; machine learning; Medline; meta analysis (topic); organization and management; procedures; search engine","","","","","","","Howick J., Chalmers I., Glasziou P., Greenhalgh T., Heneghan C., Liberati A., Et al., Explanation of the 2011 Oxford centre for evidence-based medicine (OCEBM) levels of evidence (background document) 2016; CRD's guidance for undertaking reviews in health care 2009; Hirschman L., Burns G.A.P.C., Krallinger M., Arighi C., Cohen K.B., Valencia A., Et al., Text mining for the biocuration workflow, Database (Oxford), 2012, (2012); Liberati A., Altman D.G., Tetzlaff J., Mulrow C., Gotzsche P.C., Ioannidis J.P.A., Et al., The PRISMA statement for reporting systematic reviews and meta-analyses of studies that evaluate health care interventions: explanation and elaboration, PLoS Med, 6, (2009); Balan P.F., Gerits A., Vanduffel W., A practical application of text mining to literature on cognitive rehabilitation and enhancement through neurostimulation, Front Syst Neurosci, 8, (2014); Guyatt G.H., Oxman A.D., Montori V., Vist G., Kunz R., Brozek J., Et al., GRADE guidelines: 5.

Materials and methods We included all patients implanted with an intrapericardial CF-LVAD as BTT, between January 2012 and December 2016. Primary outcomes were overall survival, survival on waiting list and postheart transplant (HTx) survival. The outcomes after HTx were compared with those of a contemporary cohort of patients transplanted without previous CF-LVAD (No-LVAD group, nU73). Results We included 53 patients with a median age of 52 years (interquartile range: 43-59 years). Seventy-two percent were in INTERMACS profile 1-2 before implant; all entered the HTx waiting list after receiving the CF-LVAD. HTx was performed in 42 (79%) cases (LVAD group). Overall estimated survival (considering both pre-HTx and post-HTx) was 89% [95% confidence interval (CI) 81-98%] at 1 year and 80% (CI 70-92%) at 2 years. The estimated survival on waiting list was 91% (CI 80-100%) at 6 months, whereas the 1-year estimated post-HTx survival was 88% (CI 79- 98%). The Kaplan-Meier curves of survival after HTx of LVAD versus No-LVAD group were comparable (log-rank PU0.54), as well as the rates of post-HTx adverse events. A multivariable model of survival after HTx, accounting for the most relevant patient characteristics, identified LVAD use as a significant protective factor [LVAD versus No-LVAD hazard ratio 0.22 (CI 0.06-0.91)]. Conclusion The use of new-generation intrapericardial CFLVADs as a BTT resulted, in our series, in satisfactory pre- HTx and post-HTx outcomes. © 2018 Italian Federation of Cardiology - I.F.C.

In the early phase of the pandemic in Italy, the decentralized healthcare system allowed regions to adopt different testing strategies. The objective of this paper is to assess the impact of the extensive testing of symptomatic individuals and their contacts on the number of hospitalizations against a more stringent testing strategy limited to suspected cases with severe respiratory illness and an epidemiological link to a COVID-19 case. A Poisson regression modelling approach was adopted. In the first model developed, the cumulative daily number of positive cases and a temporal trend were considered as explanatory variables. In the second, the cumulative daily number of swabs was further added. The explanatory variable, given by the number of swabs over time, explained most of the observed differences in the number of hospitalizations between the two strategies. The percentage of the expected error dropped from 70% of the first, simpler model to 15%. Increasing testing to detect and isolate infected individuals in the early phase of an outbreak improves the capability to reduce the spread of serious infections, lessening the burden of hospitals. © 2021 by the authors.

Background: A correct pre-procedural risk stratification of patients with NIDCM and VT undergoing CA is crucial. The performance of different pre-procedural risk stratification approaches to predict outcomes of CA of VT in patients with NIDCM is unknown. Methods: The study compared the performance of 8 prognostic scores (SHFM [Seattle Heart Failure Model], MAGGIC [Meta-analysis Global Group in Chronic Heart Failure], ADHERE [Acute Decompensated Heart Failure National Registry], EFFECT [Enhanced Feedback for Effective Cardiac Treatment-Heart Failure], OPTIMIZE-HF [Organized Program to Initiate Lifesaving Treatment in Hospitalized Patients with Heart Failure], CHARM [Candesartan in Heart Failure-Assessment of Reduction in Mortality], EuroSCORE [European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation], and PAINESD [Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, Age > 60 Years, Ischemic Cardiomyopathy, New York Heart Association Functional Class III or IV, Ejection Fraction <25%, Presentation With VT Storm, Diabetes Mellitus]) for the endpoints of death/cardiac transplantation and VT recurrence in 282 consecutive patients (age 59 ± 15 years, left ventricular ejection fraction: 36 ± 13%) with NIDCM undergoing CA of VT. Discrimination and calibration of each model were evaluated through area under the curve (AUC) of receiver-operating characteristic curve and goodness-of-fit test. Results: After a median follow-up of 48 (interquartile range: 19–67) months, 43 patients (15%) died, 24 (9%) underwent heart transplantation, and 58 (21%) experienced VT recurrence. The prognostic accuracy of SHFM (AUC = 0.89; goodness-of-fit p = 0.68 for death/transplant and AUC = 0.77; goodness-of-fit p = 0.16 for VT recurrence) and PAINESD (AUC = 0.83; goodness-of-fit p = 0.24 for death/transplant and AUC = 0.68; goodness-of-fit p = 0.58 for VT recurrence) were significantly superior to that of other scores. Conclusions: In patients with NIDCM and VT undergoing CA, the SHFM and PAINESD risk scores are powerful predictors of recurrent VT and death/transplant during follow-up, with similar performance and significantly superior to other scores. A pre-procedural calculation of the SHFM and PAINESD can be useful to predict outcomes. © 2019 American College of Cardiology Foundation","catheter ablation; dilated cardiomyopathy; electroanatomical mapping;

Predictive equations are widely used to estimate resting energy expenditure (REE). In the study, we conducted a systematic review of REE predictive equations in the elderly population and compared them in an experimental population. Studies involving subjects older than 65 years of age that evaluated the performance of a predictive equation vs. a gold standard were included. The retrieved equations were then tested on a sample of 88 elderly subjects enrolled in an Italian nursing home to evaluate the agreement among the estimated REEs. The agreement was assessed using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). A web application, equationer, was developed to calculate all the estimated REEs according to the available variables. The review identified 68 studies (210 different equations). The agreement among the equations in our sample was higher for equations with fewer parameters, especially those that included body weight, ICC = 0.75 (95% CI = 0.69–0.81). There is great heterogeneity among REE estimates. Such differences should be considered and evaluated when estimates are applied to particularly fragile populations since the results have the potential to impact the patient’s overall clinical outcome. © 2021 by the authors.

Objectives: Contribute to the investigation and development of effective and reliable methods for dietary monitoring based on raw kinetic data generated by wearable devices. Methods: This study uses resources from the NOTION study. A total of 20 healthy subjects (9 women and 11 men, aged 20–31 years) were equipped with two commercial smartwatches during four eating occasions under semi-naturalistic conditions. All meals were video-recorded, and acceleration data were extracted and analyzed. Food recognition on these features was performed using random forest (RF) models with 5-fold cross-validation. The performance of the classifiers was expressed in out-of-bag sensitivity and specificity. Results: Acceleration along the x-axis and power show the highest and lowest rates of median variable importance, respectively. Increasing the window size from 1 to 5 s leads to a gain in performance for almost all food items. The RF classifier reaches the highest performance in identifying meatballs (89.4% sensitivity and 81.6% specificity) and the lowest in identifying sandwiches (74.6% sensitivity and 72.5% specificity). Conclusions: Monitoring food items using simple wristband-mounted wearable devices is feasible and accurate for some foods while unsatisfactory for others. Machine learning tools are necessary to deal with the complexity of signals gathered by the devices, and research is ongoing to improve accuracy further and work on large-scale and real-time implementation and testing. © 2025 by the authors.","acceleration data; dietary monitoring; food recognition; kinetic data; random forest; wearable devices","","","","","","","","Riley L., Cowan M., Noncommunicable Diseases Progress Monitor 2022, (2022); Magrini M.L., Minto C., Lazzarini F., Martinato M., Gregori D., Wearable Devices for Caloric Intake Assessment: State of Art and Future Developments, Open Nurs.

The COVID-19 outbreak hugely contributed to this dramatic increase in the volume of published research. Currently, text mining of the volume of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 publications is limited to the first months of the outbreak. We aim to identify the major topics in COVID-19 literature collected from several citational sources and analyze the temporal trend from November 2019 to December 2021. Methods: We performed an extensive literature search on SARS-Cov-2 and COVID-19 publications on PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science (WoS) and a structural topic modelling on the retrieved abstracts. The temporal trend of the recognized topics was analyzed. Furthermore, a comparison between our corpus and the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19) repository was performed. Results: We collected 269,186 publications and identified 10 topics. The most popular topic was related to the clinical pictures of the COVID-19 outbreak, which has a constant trend, and the least popular includes studies on COVID-19 literature and databases. “Telemedicine”, “Vaccine development”, and “Epidemiology” were popular topics in the early phase of the pandemic; increasing topics in the last period are “COVID-19 impact on mental health”, “Forecasting”, and “Molecular Biology”. “Education” was the second most popular topic, which emerged in September 2020. Conclusions: We identified 10 topics for classifying COVID-19 research publications and estimated a nonlinear temporal trend that gives an overview of their unfolding over time. Several citational databases must be searched to retrieve a complete set of studies despite the efforts to build repositories for COVID-19 literature. Our collected data can help build a more focused literature search between November 2019 and December 2021 when carrying out systematic and rapid reviews and our findings can give a complete picture on the topic. © The Author(s) 2022.","COVID-19; information retrieval; open science; research practice; science communications; text mining","","","","","","Università degli Studi di Torino, UNITO, (BERP_RILO_21_01); Università degli Studi di Torino, UNITO","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was funded by the University of Turin (BERP_RILO_21_01).

Containment measures were approved soon thereafter. The present study aims at providing a first look at the impact of the containment measures on the outbreak progression in the Veneto region, Italy. Methods A Bayesian changepoint analysis was used to identify the changing speed of the epidemic curve. Then, a piecewise polynomial model was considered to fit the data in the first period before the detected changepoint. In this time interval, that is, the weeks from 27 February to 12 March, a quadratic growth was identified by a generalised additive model (GAM). Finally, the model was used to generate the projection of the expected number of hospitalisations at 2 weeks based on the epidemic speed before the changepoint. Such estimates were then compared with the actual outbreak behaviour. Results The comparison between the observed and predicted hospitalisation curves highlights a slowdown on the total COVID-19 hospitalisations after the onset of containment measures. The estimated daily slowdown effect of the epidemic growth is estimated as 78 hospitalisations per day as of 27 March (95% CI 75 to 81). Conclusions The containment strategies seem to have positively impacted the progression of the COVID-19 epidemic outbreak in Veneto. © ","COVID-19; Italy; PUBLIC HEALTH","Bayes Theorem; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Disease Outbreaks; Forecasting; Hospitalization; Humans; Italy; Models, Statistical; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Public Health; Italy; Veneto; disease severity; disease spread; disease treatment; epidemic; health risk; hospital sector; public health; viral disease; Bayes theorem; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; epidemic; forecasting; hospitalization; human; Italy; pandemic; public health; statistical model; virus pneumonia","","","","","","","Xiao Y., Torok M.E., Taking the right measures to control COVID-19, Lancet Infect Dis [Internet], (2020); Anderson R.M., Heesterbeek H., Klinkenberg D., Et al., How will country-based mitigation measures influence the course of the COVID-19 epidemic?, Lancet, (2020); Barry D., Hartigan J.A., A Bayesian analysis for change point problems, J Am Stat Assoc Marzo, 88, (1993); Chambers J.M., Hastie T.J., Curatori Statistical Models in S, (1992); McFadden D., Quantitative methods for analyzing travel behaviour of individuals: Some recent developments [Internet], Cowles Foundation for Research in Economics, Yale University, (1977); R: A Language and Environment for Statistical Computing [Internet], (2015); Erdman C., Emerson J.W., Bcp: An R Package for performing a Bayesian analysis of change point problems, J Stat Softw, 23, (2007); Yee T.W., Vector Generalized Linear and Additive Models: With An Implementation in R, (2015); Kass-Hout T.A., Xu Z., McMurray P., Et al., Application of change point analysis to daily influenza-like illness emergency department visits, J Am Med Inform Assoc Novembre, 19, pp. 1075-1081, (2012); Brandenburg A., Quadratic Growth during the 2019 Novel Coronavirus Epidemic, (2020); Lei S., Jiang F., Su W., Et al., Clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients undergoing surgeries during the incubation period of COVID-19 infection, E Clin Med Aprile, (2020); Lorenzoni G., Lanera C., Azzolina D., Et al., Is a more aggressive COVID-19 case detection approach mitigating the burden on ICUs?

The availability of essential medical equipment to support patients affected by Covid-19 is globally limited. Areas covered: This perspective gives a technical view of the pandemic focusing on the main actions taken by regulatory agencies to cope with the shortage of devices. The risk/benefit assessment and the main infection control policies in the clinical practices are also looked at. Expert opinion: Regulatory agencies have amended their medical devices directives to address the pandemic, but each in a different way. In this exceptional situation scientist and technology experts in collaboration with medical specialists should work together to re-assess the risk analysis on medical equipment management and their use and re-use in this context with the aim to improve global health care Every effort must be made to provide the necessary devices at least with the minimum acceptable performances for Covid-19 patients while maintaining a high standard of safety for users. The aim of the present manuscript is to highlight the technical challenges in order to prevent, through targeted actions, operating standards from falling below the standards of care due to a lack of medical devices.

We aimed to assess the short-term effects of air pollution on ventricular arrhythmias in a population of high-risk patients with implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) or cardiac resynchronisation therapy defibrillators (ICD-CRT). Methods In this prospective multicentre study, we assessed 281 patients (median age 71 years) across nine centres in the Veneto region of Italy. Episodes of ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation that were recorded by the diagnostic device were considered in this analysis. Concentrations of particulate matter of less than 10 μm (PM10) and less than 2·5 μm (PM2·5) in aerodynamic diameter, carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, sulphur dioxide, and ozone were obtained daily from monitoring stations, and the 24 h median value was considered. Each patient was associated with exposure data from the monitoring station that was closest to their residence. Patients were followed up for 1 year and then scheduled to have a closing visit, within 1 more year. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01723761. Findings Participants were enrolled from April 1, 2011, to Sept 30, 2012, and follow-ups (completed on April 5, 2014) ranged from 637 to 1177 days (median 652 days). The incidence of episodes of ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation correlated significantly with PM2·5 (p<0·0001) but not PM10. An analysis of ventricular fibrillation episodes alone showed a significant increase in risk of higher PM2·5 (p=0·002) and PM10 values (p=0·0057). None of the gaseous pollutants were significantly linked to the occurrence of ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation. In a subgroup analysis of patients with or without a previous myocardial infarction, only the first showed a significant association between particulate matter and episodes of ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation. Interpretation Particulate matter has acute pro-arrhythmic effects in a population of high-risk patients, which increase on exposure to fine particles and in patients who have experienced a previous myocardial infarction. The time sequence of the arrhythmic events suggests there is an underlying neurally mediated mechanism. From a clinical point of view, the results of our study should encourage physicians to also consider environmental risk when addressing the prevention of arrhythmic events, particularly in patients with coronary heart disease, advising them to avoid exposure to high levels of fine particulate matter.

Conventional surveillance methods, such as laboratory-based reporting and physician notifications, often fail to enable early detection, prompting the exploration of innovative solutions. Social media platforms, combined with machine learning (ML), offer new opportunities for real-time monitoring and outbreak analysis. This systematic review evaluated the role of social networks in detecting and managing foodborne illnesses, particularly through the use of ML techniques to identify unreported events and enhance outbreak response. This review analyzed studies published up to December 2024 that utilized social media data and data mining to predict and prevent foodborne diseases. A comprehensive search was conducted across PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, Arxiv, Scopus, and Web of Science databases, excluding clinical trials, case reports, and reviews. Two independent reviewers screened studies using Covidence, with a third resolving conflicts. Study variables included social media platforms, ML techniques (shallow and deep learning), and model performance, with a risk of bias assessed using the PROBAST tool. The results highlighted Twitter and Yelp as primary data sources, with shallow learning models dominating the field. Many studies were identified as having high or unclear risk of bias. This review underscored the potential of social media and ML in foodborne disease surveillance and emphasizes the need for standardized methodologies and further exploration of deep learning models. © 2025 by the authors.","foodborne illness; machine learning; social media; systematic review","","","","","","","","Pires S.M., Desta B.N., Mughini-Gras L., Mmbaga B.T., Fayemi O.E., Salvador E.M., Gobena T., Majowicz S.E., Hald T., Hoejskov P.S., Et al., Burden of Foodborne Diseases: Think Global, Act Local, Curr.

Therefore, wearable devices could be strategic for minimizing years of disability in old age and monitoring patients’ lifestyles and health. The purpose of this study was to assess the feasibility of using smart devices to monitor patients’ physical activity in a primary care setting. To assess the acceptance of this novel technology from the point of view of both patients and healthcare professionals, two questionnaires (one paper-based and one ex-novo developed) were administered to 11 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and a non-compliant behavior towards the therapeutic indications of their general practitioner (GP). Seven participants would continue to use a wearable activity tracker to monitor their health. We observed that 75% of patients reported a device’s characteristics satisfaction level of over 80% of the total score assigned to this dimension. No differences were observed in the questionnaire’s scores between the two professionals categories (GPs and nurses). Three dimensions (equipment characteristics, subjective norm, perceived risks, perceived ease-of-use and facilitating conditions) correlated > 0.5 with the device’s acceptability level. Some weak correlations were observed between healthcare professionals’ perception and patients’ parameters, particularly between the dimensions of collaboration and web interface ease-of-use and patients’ median number of steps and hours of sleep. In conclusion, despite the limited number of subjects involved, a good acceptance level towards these non-medical devices was observed, according to both patients’ and healthcare professionals’ impressions. © 2021 by the authors.

The ability to promptly forecast the epidemic impact on the occupancy of beds in the ICU is a key issue for adequate management of the health care system. Despite this, most of the literature on predictive COVID-19 models in Italy has focused on predicting the number of infections, leaving trends in ordinary hospitalizations and ICU occupancies in the background. This work aims to present an ETS approach (Exponential Smoothing Time Series) time series forecasting tool for admissions to the ICU admissions based on ETS models. The results of the forecasting model are presented for the regions most affected by the epidemic, such as Veneto, Lombardy, Emilia-Romagna, and Piedmont. The mean absolute percentage errors (MAPE) between observed and predicted admissions to the ICU admissions remain lower than 11% for all considered geographical areas.

In subjects affected by Crohn’s disease (CD), extra-intestinal manifestations (EIMs) have a remarkable potential impact on health status. Increasing numbers of patient characteristics and the small size of analyzed samples make EIMs prediction very difficult. Under such constraints, Bayesian machine learning techniques (BMLTs) have been proposed as a robust alternative to classical models for outcome prediction. This study aims to determine whether BMLT could improve EIM prediction and statistical support for the decision-making process of clinicians. (2) Methods: Three of the most popular BMLTs were employed in this study: Naϊve Bayes (NB), Bayesian Network (BN) and Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART). They were applied to retrospective observational Italian study of IBD genetics. (3) Results: The performance of the model is strongly affected by the features of the dataset, and BMLTs poorly classify EIM appearance. (4) Conclusions: This study shows that BMLTs perform worse than expected� in classifying the presence the of EIMs compared classical statistical tools in a context where mixed genetic and data� are available but relevant data are also missing, as often occurs in clinical practice. © 2019 by the authors.
